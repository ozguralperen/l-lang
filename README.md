# l-lang
Llang is the programming language for law. In this project, my goal is to develop a truly universal tool for law, 
on which many different plugins such as natural language processing can work, rather than just producing a tool
to create programmable contracts and legal texts.

## What kind of revolution does Llang aim to create?

1. In this way, lawyers or people who will benefit from legal services will be able to quickly 
create the legal content of contracts, applications or petitions by getting data from legal documents with machine learning add-ons,
and at the same time, they will be able to check their timeliness at any time.

2. In addition, it will also include the ability to easily format documents, organize contents such as person, 
institution, price, percentage in the contracts with loops, lists, variables and functions, and control them between 
parties by the network.

3. And besides all these, my other aim is to ensure that all projects and developments in the field of law can be created more easily, 
faster (just like integrating someone's library or api in the programming world) with the network to be created between lawyers
through this programming language.

## How will this project progress during HTNE Beyond?

First of all, a compiler layer will be created that includes the basic content of the project 
and can generate legal texts quickly. It will be ensured that NLP tools are run on this layer, 
and when requested, legal texts will be controlled directly by this language procedure and when 
requested, these documents will be checked between the parties with the responses formatted according to the requests 
from the network.

With Llang, I aim for a revolutionary programming language that can connect every lawyer to each other,
replacing dozens of software that are complex and non-customizable (that cannot contain a desired feature) 
that are different from automation or solutions.  They will be able to can transmit their codes and projects 
between each other, or receive code libraries to be created by software companies.
